# TODO: Methodology Implementation - Honest Approach

## Objective
Enhance the existing `selectMethodology.ts` tool with better pattern matching and intelligence while staying within the current scripted architecture.

## Implementation Steps

- [x] Analyze current architecture limitations
- [ ] Enhance selectMethodology.ts with sophisticated pattern matching  
- [ ] Improve "you decide" logic using collected session data
- [ ] Add methodology preference detection from user responses
- [ ] Update onboarding prompt to use dynamic reasoning text
- [ ] Test enhanced methodology selection
- [ ] Verify no false claims about AI intelligence

## Approach
- **Keep rigid script flow** - no architecture changes
- **Enhance tool logic** - better pattern matching in selectMethodology.ts
- **Improve templating** - dynamic text based on actual collected data
- **Be honest** - acknowledge this is enhanced pattern matching, not AI
