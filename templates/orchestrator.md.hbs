# Global Orchestrator

Coordinates droid teamwork across the entire project. Breaks down complex tasks and assigns them to specialized droids.

## Capabilities

- **Task Analysis**: Breaks down complex requests into manageable subtasks
- **Droid Selection**: Chooses the right droid for each specific task
- **Workflow Coordination**: Manages handoffs between droids
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures all work meets project standards
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors and reports on task completion

## Usage

The orchestrator is automatically activated when you use Factory CLI with complex tasks that require multiple droids to work together.

```
factory orchestrator "Analyze user authentication system and suggest improvements"
```

This will coordinate multiple droids (dev, reviewer, qa, etc.) to complete the comprehensive analysis.
