## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-25

### üöÄ **INSTANT COMMAND AVAILABILITY - Perfect User Experience**

#### ‚ú® Zero-Friction Installation
**DroidForge commands are now available immediately after `npm install`!**

No MCP configuration required first. No waiting for first access. Commands work instantly.

#### üéØ **New Installation Flow**
**Perfect User Experience**:
1. `npm install -g droidforge` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Commands instantly available
2. `/forge-start` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Works immediately in any directory
3. MCP configuration happens during onboarding (guided)

#### üîß **Technical Implementation**
- **postinstall script**: Automatically runs after `npm install -g droidforge`
- **Immediate installation**: Creates `~/.factory/commands/` during package installation
- **Smart detection**: Only installs if commands don't already exist
- **Graceful fallback**: Falls back to auto-installation on first MCP access if postinstall fails

#### üéÅ **What This Means**
- **Zero friction**: Install and immediately start using
- **No prerequisites**: No MCP configuration needed before first use
- **Universal access**: Commands work in any directory instantly
- **Guided setup**: MCP configuration happens when needed, with guidance

#### üìç **File Installation**
Commands installed immediately to `~/.factory/commands/`:
- `/forge-start` - Begin onboarding or show status  
- `/forge-status` - Check your team and activity
- `/forge-guide` - View team handbook
- `/forge-removeall` - Clean removal when finished
- `/df` - Your orchestrator for work coordination

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-25

### üéØ **GLOBAL COMMANDS - Complete Chicken-and-Egg Solution**

#### ‚ú® Revolutionary Change
**DroidForge commands are now globally available immediately after installation!**

No more chicken-and-egg problem. No per-project setup required. Install once, use everywhere.

#### üåç **Global Installation**
- **Global scope**: Commands installed to `~/.factory/commands/` (personal scope)
- **Universal access**: `/forge-start`, `/forge-status`, `/forge-guide`, `/forge-removeall`, `/df` work in any directory
- **Instant availability**: Available immediately after `npm install -g droidforge` + MCP configuration
- **Zero setup**: No per-project initialization required

#### üöÄ **New User Experience**
**Before (Broken)**:
1. Install DroidForge ‚Üí 2. Try `/forge-start` ‚Üí 3. ‚ùå Command not found

**After (Perfect)**:  
1. Install DroidForge ‚Üí 2. `/forge-start` ‚Üí 3. ‚úÖ Onboarding starts immediately

#### üîß **Technical Implementation**
- **Auto-installation**: Global commands installed when DroidForge MCP tools are first accessed
- **New MCP tool**: `install_global_commands` for explicit global installation  
- **Factory CLI compatible**: Uses standard `~/.factory/commands/` directory structure
- **Smart detection**: Only installs if commands don't already exist

#### üéÅ **What This Means**
- **For new users**: Seamless onboarding experience, no setup frustration
- **For existing users**: Commands upgrade automatically to global scope
- **For teams**: Share DroidForge across projects with zero per-project overhead  
- **For developers**: Clean architecture following Factory CLI conventions

#### üìç **File Locations**
- **Global commands**: `~/.factory/commands/` (forge management commands)
- **Project droids**: `<repo>/.factory/droids/` (specialist AI droids)
- **Project manifest**: `<repo>/.factory/droids-manifest.json`

**The chicken-and-egg problem is completely solved!** üéâ

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-25

### üîß **AUTO-INSTALLATION FIX - Chicken-and-Egg Solution**

#### ‚úÖ Problem Solved
**Issue**: Users needed `/forge-start` command to begin onboarding, but forge commands were only installed AFTER onboarding completed. This created an impossible situation for first-time users.

**Solution**: DroidForge now automatically installs all forge commands the first time it's accessed in any repository.

#### üöÄ **New Auto-Installation Behavior**
- **Instant Availability**: `/forge-start`, `/forge-status`, `/forge-guide`, `/forge-removeall` commands are now automatically created
- **First Access**: Commands are installed the moment DroidForge's `get_status` tool is called
- **Proper Format**: Commands created in `.factory/commands/` with correct Markdown and YAML frontmatter  
- **Droid CLI Compatible**: Works seamlessly with Droid CLI's slash command system
- **Zero Configuration**: No user action required - commands just appear

#### üîÑ Updated File Paths  
- **Fixed manifest location**: Now correctly uses `.factory/droids-manifest.json` (was using outdated `.droidforge/` path)
- **Consistent structure**: All DroidForge files now properly use `.factory/` directory

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Enhanced Reliability**
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Graceful failure with detailed logging
- **Smart detection**: Only installs commands if they don't already exist  
- **Atomic operations**: Commands installed safely with proper file locking
- **Audit logging**: All auto-installation events logged for troubleshooting

#### üéØ **User Experience**
**Before**: Users confused by missing `/forge-start` command
**After**: Commands immediately available, onboarding flow works seamlessly

#### Technical Details
- Modified `get_status` tool to check for forge commands existence
- Auto-installs complete command suite if missing
- Uses same `buildDefaultCommands()` logic as normal onboarding
- Maintains full compatibility with existing installations

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-25

### üêõ **CRITICAL FIX**
- **Fixed bin paths** - Removed leading `./` that caused npm to reject binary commands
- v1.0.0 published but commands were broken - **use v1.0.1 instead**

---

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-25 [BROKEN - USE 1.0.1]

### üéØ **BREAKING CHANGE - Professional Naming Convention**

#### Command Names Updated
To align with professional MCP server conventions (GitHub, Slack, etc.), the binary command names have been updated for clarity:

**BEFORE:**
- `droidforge` ‚Üí stdio mode
- `droidforge-http` ‚Üí HTTP mode
- Configuration: `/mcp add droidforge droidforge` ‚Üê Confusing!

**AFTER:**
- `droidforge-mcp-server` ‚Üí stdio mode
- `droidforge-mcp-server-http` ‚Üí HTTP mode
- Configuration: `/mcp add droidforge droidforge-mcp-server` ‚Üê Clear distinction!

#### üì¶ Installation (UNCHANGED)
**Package name remains simple:** `npm install -g droidforge`

The package name stays as `droidforge` for easy installation. Only the executable command names changed to match professional MCP naming patterns used by other servers.

#### üîÑ Migration Guide

**If you already configured DroidForge:**
1. Remove old configuration: `/mcp remove droidforge`
2. Add with new command: `/mcp add droidforge droidforge-mcp-server`

**Or manually update your `mcp.json`:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "droidforge": {
      "command": "droidforge-mcp-server"  // ‚Üê Changed from "droidforge"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Why This Change?
- **Clarity:** Command name now distinct from identifier in `/mcp add` command
- **Professional:** Matches naming conventions used by other MCP servers
- **Consistency:** Aligns with industry-standard patterns

#### Impact
- **Breaking:** Existing installations must update configuration
- **One-time:** Simple migration, takes 30 seconds
- **Future-proof:** Professional naming convention for long-term clarity
