## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-21

### üî• **MAJOR REWRITE - AI-POWERED INTERVIEWS**
- **COMPLETELY REPLACED** keyword-matching interview system with AI-powered analysis
- **BMAD ANALYST APPROACH**: Now uses AI to understand user intent and generate intelligent follow-up questions
- **CONVERSATIONAL INTELLIGENCE**: AI analyzes full conversation context instead of simple keyword matching
- **DYNAMIC QUESTION GENERATION**: Follow-up questions adapt based on user responses and conversation flow
- **ELIMINATED ALL KEYWORD MATCHING**: No more hardcoded patterns or rigid keyword detection

### Fixed
- **Completely removed** all keyword-based domain detection
- **Replaced** static question patterns with AI-generated responses
- **Fixed** conversation flow that was basically a digital form
- **Eliminated** false positive domain assignments and confusing question sequences

### New Architecture
- `generateFollowUpQuestion()` now uses AI to analyze conversation and generate intelligent responses
- `analyzeConversationWithAI()` uses AI to extract project insights from conversation
- `generateAIResponse()` framework for integrating with AI models (Claude/OpenAI/etc.)
- Async conversation loop that properly handles AI response generation

### Example Transformation
**Before (Keyword Matching):**
User: "software" ‚Üí System: "That's fantastic! Education is such an important field..." ‚ùå

**After (AI-Powered):**
User: "We're a bakery struggling with manual orders" ‚Üí AI: "Tell me about the problem you're trying to solve." ‚úÖ

### Technical Changes
- Removed ALL keyword-based functions and pattern matching
- Implemented async AI analysis functions
- Created conversation context awareness
- Added framework for AI model integration (TODO: Connect to actual AI APIs)

## [0.3.5] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- Fixed conversation system incorrectly assuming domains from single words
- Improved tech stack detection for "software", "app", "application" responses
- Enhanced domain detection to require contextual keywords (not just word matching)
- Fixed education domain triggering from non-educational contexts
- Better conversation flow that distinguishes between tech type and industry domain

### Improved
- More intelligent question sequencing: tech type ‚Üí domain ‚Üí requirements
- Context-aware domain detection requiring multiple related keywords
- Clearer separation between technology stack and business domain conversations
- Reduced false positive domain assignments
