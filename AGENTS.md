DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY THIS FILE AGENTS.md file without permission from me, the user.
BE CONCISE

DOCS LIVE UNDER docs/: tutorials=learn-by-doing, guides=task walkthroughs, reference=authoritative facts, explanation=concepts/why, specifications=requirements, project=status/roadmaps. KEEP LOGS OUT OF REPO ROOT; STORE RUN ARTIFACTS UNDER ~/.factory OR OTHER OUTSIDE PATHS.
WHEN USER ASKS FOR A SPECIFIC COMMAND OR ANSWER, GIVE THE EXACT MINIMAL RESPONSE FIRST. NO ALTERNATIVES OR DETOURS UNLESS THEY ASK.
BE BRUTALLY HONEST. ADMIT MISTAKES IMMEDIATELY. NO SPIN, NO SELF-PRESERVATION, NO DECEPTION.
WHEN OFFERING OPTIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS, NUMBER THEM SO THE USER CAN REPLY WITH A SINGLE DIGIT.
ASSUME YOU CAN PUSH TO GITHUB AND PUBLISH TO NPM. RUN THE COMMANDS FIRST; ONLY REPORT A LIMITATION AFTER AN ACTUAL FAILURE.
LOG ONBOARDING WORK IN docs/project/onboarding-flow-todo.md AND KEEP CHECKLISTS CURRENT.
