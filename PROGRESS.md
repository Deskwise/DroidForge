## How to Update This File

### For Droids Working in Parallel

1. **Update your section only** (don't touch other workstreams' sections)
2. **Use clear timestamps** when making updates
3. **Update progress percentage** based on TODO completion
4. **Mark milestones** as completed with [x]
5. **Note any blockers** immediately
6. **Ask questions** in the Questions section

### Example Update

```markdown
## Workstream 1: CoreDev

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress  
**Progress:** 35%

### Milestones
- [x] Phase 1: Synchronization primitives complete
- [ ] Phase 2: Read/Write locks implemented (in progress)
- [ ] Phase 3: Deadlock detection working
- [ ] Phase 4: State persistence functional

### Last Update
**2024-10-23 14:30** - Completed Phase 1. ExecutionLock class working.
All manager methods now wrapped with mutex. Tests passing.
Starting Phase 2: ResourceLockManager implementation.
```

## Next Steps

1. Run `node parallel-droids.js` to start execution
2. Monitor this file for progress
3. Check `logs/` directory for detailed logs
4. Run `git status` periodically to see changes
5. Wait for all droids to complete
6. Run integration tests
7. Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
