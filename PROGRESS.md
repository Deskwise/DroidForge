- [x] Conflict detection working
- [x] Atomic merge operational

### Last Update
**2025-10-24** - âœ… WORKSTREAM COMPLETE

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `src/mcp/execution/staging.ts` with full StagingManager implementation
- Created `src/mcp/execution/merger.ts` with full ExecutionMerger implementation
- Implemented IStagingManager interface with:
  - `createStaging()` - Creates isolated copy of repo for each node
  - `collectChanges()` - Collects file changes using glob patterns
  - `cleanStaging()` - Cleans up staging directories
- Implemented IExecutionMerger interface with:
  - `merge()` - Merges changes from all staging areas
  - `detectConflicts()` - SHA-256 based conflict detection
- Created comprehensive test suites:
  - 8 tests for StagingManager (all passing)
  - 7 tests for ExecutionMerger (all passing)
- All tests passing with 100% coverage of new code
- No lint errors
- Ready for integration with CoreDev's ExecutionManager

## How to Update This File

### For Droids Working in Parallel

1. **Update your section only** (don't touch other workstreams' sections)
2. **Use clear timestamps** when making updates
3. **Update progress percentage** based on TODO completion
4. **Mark milestones** as completed with [x]
5. **Note any blockers** immediately
6. **Ask questions** in the Questions section

### Example Update

```markdown
## Workstream 1: CoreDev

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress  
**Progress:** 35%

### Milestones
- [x] Phase 1: Synchronization primitives complete
- [ ] Phase 2: Read/Write locks implemented (in progress)
- [ ] Phase 3: Deadlock detection working
- [ ] Phase 4: State persistence functional

### Last Update
**2024-10-23 14:30** - Completed Phase 1. ExecutionLock class working.
