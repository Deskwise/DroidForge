# âš¡ Quick Start: Parallel Droids Development

## The Simplest Way to Get Started

### Step 1: I Create Coordination Files (2 minutes)
You say: **"Create all coordination files"**

I generate:
- Interface contracts
- Progress tracker  
- Todo lists for 4 workstreams
- File ownership map

### Step 2: You Give Simple Command (30 seconds)

Just copy-paste this into Droid CLI:

```
I need 4 droids to work in parallel on the parallelization roadmap:

Droid 1 (CoreDev): Implement Phases 1-4 (synchronization, locks, deadlock, persistence)
- Files: manager.ts, synchronization.ts, resourceLocks.ts, deadlockDetector.ts, persistence.ts
- Read: PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md phases 1-4, INTERFACES.md
- Update: TODO_WS1_CORE.md and PROGRESS.md

Droid 2 (IsolationDev): Implement Phase 5 (staging and merging)
- Files: staging.ts, merger.ts
- Read: PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md phase 5, INTERFACES.md
- Update: TODO_WS2_ISOLATION.md and PROGRESS.md

Droid 3 (InfraDev): Implement Phases 6, 7, 9 (event bus, resource matching, observability)
- Files: eventBus.ts, resourceMatcher.ts, metrics.ts, healthCheck.ts
- Read: PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md phases 6-7-9, INTERFACES.md
- Update: TODO_WS3_INFRA.md and PROGRESS.md

Droid 4 (TestDev): Implement Phase 8 (comprehensive tests)
- Files: __tests__/*.test.ts
- Read: PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md phase 8, all execution/*.ts files
- Update: TODO_WS4_TESTS.md and PROGRESS.md

Start all 4 now. Each should work independently, follow interfaces, 
and update progress. Coordinate integrations through me.
```

### Step 3: Watch Them Work (autonomous)

Droids will:
- Read their assignments
- Start implementing
- Update todo lists
- Commit code
- Report progress

### Step 4: You Orchestrate (occasionally)

Check progress:
```bash
cat PROGRESS.md
```

Coordinate integration:
```bash
"CoreDev and IsolationDev: integrate staging into requestNext()"
```

Review and merge:
```bash
git status
git diff
npm test
```

## That's It!

No complex git workflows. No manual coordination. Just spawn and orchestrate.

---

## Alternative: Start with One Droid First

If you want to go slower:

```
"Start with just CoreDev. Implement Phase 1 (synchronization) 
following PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md. Update TODO_WS1_CORE.md."
```

Then spawn others as you gain confidence.

## What You'll See

```
[10:00] You: Start 4 droids (command above)
[10:01] CoreDev: Starting Phase 1, installing async-mutex...
[10:01] IsolationDev: Starting Phase 5, creating staging.ts...
[10:01] InfraDev: Starting Phase 6, creating eventBus.ts...
[10:01] TestDev: Starting Phase 8, writing concurrency tests...

[10:30] All: Updated PROGRESS.md
[10:30] You: Check progress (cat PROGRESS.md)

[11:00] CoreDev: Phase 1 complete, starting Phase 2
[11:00] IsolationDev: StagingManager complete
[11:00] InfraDev: EventBus complete
[11:00] TestDev: 20 tests written

[12:00] You: CoreDev + IsolationDev integrate
[12:30] Integration complete, tests pass âœ…

[14:00] You: All droids, status check
[14:00] All: 60% complete, on track for 2.5 week timeline
```

Ready? Say **"Yes, let's start"** ðŸš€
