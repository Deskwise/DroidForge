# DroidForge Quick Start

Get up and running with DroidForge in 5 minutes.

## What is DroidForge?

**DroidForge doesn't give you generic AI assistants. It builds a custom development team specifically for YOUR codebase.**

It analyzes your repository - understanding your languages, frameworks, architecture, and patterns - then creates specialized AI agents (droids) who are experts in YOUR specific tech stack. Each droid knows your project intimately and produces code that fits naturally.

Think of it as automatically assembling your ideal development team, where each member is a specialist in exactly what your project needs.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 16 or higher
- **Factory.ai Droid CLI** installed and configured
- A code repository to work on

## Installation

### 1. Install the Package

```bash
npm install -g droidforge
```

Or, clone and build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deskwise/DroidForge.git
cd DroidForge
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Configure with Factory.ai

Add DroidForge as an MCP server:

```bash
/mcp add droidforge droidforge-mcp-server
```

That's it! The server will start automatically when needed.

## First Time Usage

### Step 1: Start DroidForge

In your Droid CLI session, type:

```
/forge-start
```

**New Repository:**
- DroidForge will scan your codebase
- Ask about your project goal
- Suggest a methodology (Agile, TDD, etc.)
- Propose a team of specialist droids
- Show live boot logs as the team is created

**Returning to Existing Repository:**
- Shows a dashboard with your current team
- Lists available commands
- Ready to accept requests immediately

### Step 2: Work with Your Team

Use the orchestrator to coordinate your droid team:

```
/df Implement authentication with JWT tokens
```

The `df` (DroidForge) command routes requests to `df-orchestrator`, who:
- Creates an execution plan
- Delegates tasks to appropriate specialists
- Coordinates parallel work when safe
- Reports progress and results

### Step 3: Monitor Progress

Check execution status:

```
/forge-status
```

View recent logs:

```
/forge-logs
```

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/forge-start` | Initialize or return to DroidForge |
| `/forge-guide` | View the user guide |
| `/forge-status` | Check execution status |
| `/forge-logs` | View activity logs |
| `/forge-add-droid` | Add a new specialist to the team |
| `/forge-removeall` | Clean up all DroidForge data |
| `/forge-help` | Show command reference |
| `/df <request>` | Send a request to the orchestrator |

## Common Workflows

### Adding a New Feature

```
/df Add a REST API endpoint for user profiles with CRUD operations
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Analyze the request
2. Create a plan with dependencies
3. Assign tasks to appropriate droids
4. Coordinate implementation
5. Run tests
6. Report completion

### Refactoring Code

```
/df Refactor the authentication module to use a repository pattern
```

### Writing Tests

```
/df Write comprehensive unit tests for the payment service
```

### Fixing Bugs

```
/df Fix the memory leak in the WebSocket connection handler
```

## Directory Structure

After initialization, DroidForge creates:

```
your-repo/
â”œâ”€â”€ .factory/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ droids/           # Droid definitions (*.json)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ droids-manifest.json  # Team configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exec/             # Execution state and staging areas
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ commands/         # Installed slash commands (*.md)
â””â”€â”€ docs/
    â””â”€â”€ DroidForge_user_guide_en.md  # Generated guide
```

## Configuration Files

### Droid Definitions (`.droidforge/droids/*.json`)

Each droid has a JSON file specifying:
- **Name and role**
- **Capabilities and specialization**
- **Instructions and guidelines**
- **File access patterns**

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "api-specialist",
  "role": "API Development",
  "capabilities": ["REST API", "OpenAPI", "Authentication"],
  "instructions": "Focus on API endpoints, validation, and documentation"
}
```

### Manifest (`.droidforge/manifest.json`)

The manifest tracks:
- Project goal
- Chosen methodology
- Team roster
- Last activity timestamp

## Advanced Features

### Parallel Orchestration

DroidForge can run multiple droids simultaneously on independent tasks:

```
/df Implement user authentication AND write API documentation
```

The orchestrator will:
- Detect independent tasks
- Assign to different droids
- Coordinate via resource locking
- Merge results safely

Parallel execution deep dive is being refreshed (archived notes live under `docs/_archive_legacy/explanation/`).

### Snapshots

Create a snapshot before major changes:

```
/forge-snapshot "Before authentication refactor"
```

Restore if needed:

```
/forge-restore
```

### Custom Specialists

Add a custom droid to your team:

```
/forge-add-droid
```

Follow the prompts to define:
- Droid name and role
- Specialization and skills
- File patterns to work on

## Troubleshooting

### "No droids found"

Run `/forge-start` to initialize the team.

### "Execution failed"

Check logs with `/forge-logs` and the execution status with `/forge-status`.

### Conflicts During Parallel Work

DroidForge uses resource locking to prevent conflicts. If one occurs:
1. Check `/ forge-status` for details
2. Review staging areas in `.droidforge/exec/`
3. Manually resolve if needed

### Clean Start

To reset everything and remove all DroidForge data:

```
/forge-removeall
```

**Safety confirmation required:**
1. You'll see a preview of what will be removed (droids, files, counts)
2. Type exactly: `remove all droids` to confirm
3. Confirmation is case-insensitive ("REMOVE ALL DROIDS" works)
4. Wrong confirmation cancels with no changes

After removal, run `/forge-start` to reinitialize.
