# Documentation Consistency Report

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** DRAFT

## 1. Executive Summary

A systematic review of all active documentation has revealed several inconsistencies, primarily stemming from a misalignment between the ambitious design specifications for an intelligent onboarding system and the current, simpler implementation. This report details the specific issues found in each document and proposes a set of corrective actions.

## 2. Core Inconsistency

The central issue is that the documentation often describes the *planned* intelligent onboarding system (as detailed in `docs/specifications/implementation-plan.md`) as if it were fully implemented. The `docs/project/audit-log.md` correctly identifies this gap.

## 3. Document-Specific Inconsistencies

### 3.1. `CHANGELOG.md`

*   **Issue**: Inaccurate claim in v2.0.0 that "conversational onboarding" was fully implemented.
*   **Impact**: Misleads users and contributors about the current capabilities of the application.

### 3.2. `QUICKSTART.md`

*   **Issue**: Outdated installation instructions. The manual JSON configuration is no longer the primary method.
*   **Impact**: Confuses new users and creates a frustrating setup experience.
*   **Issue**: Confusing directory structure diagram.
*   **Impact**: Makes it difficult for users to understand where DroidForge stores its files.
*   **Issue**: Simplistic onboarding example.
*   **Impact**: Fails to showcase the planned intelligent data gathering capabilities.

### 3.3. `CONTRIBUTING.md`

*   **Issue**: Outdated project structure diagram.
*   **Impact**: Confuses new contributors and makes it harder for them to navigate the codebase.
*   **Issue**: Outdated directory and contact information.
*   **Impact**: Provides incorrect information to contributors.

### 3.4. `README.md`

*   **Issue**: Incomplete description of the onboarding process.
*   **Impact**: Fails to communicate a key, albeit partially implemented, feature of the application.

## 4. Proposed Corrective Actions

A separate proposal with specific `apply_diff` patches will be created to address these issues. The general approach will be to:

1.  **Align all documentation with the current reality**: Update descriptions to reflect what is *actually* implemented.
2.  **Clarify future plans**: Clearly state that the intelligent onboarding system is a planned feature.
3.  **Correct outdated information**: Update all technical details, diagrams, and contact information.

This report will be used to guide the creation of the corrective patches.
