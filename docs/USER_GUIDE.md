# DroidForge User Guide

##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites - Install Both Tools

DroidForge works together with Factory CLI. Both tools are required:

```bash
# Install DroidForge (creates AI droids)
npm install -g droidforge

# Install Factory CLI (runs the droids)
npm install -g @factory/cli

# Verify both are working
droidforge --version
factory --version
```

### What Each Tool Does
- **DroidForge**: Analyzes your repository and generates specialized AI droids
- **Factory CLI**: Provides the runtime environment for droids to execute tasks

### First Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Initialize your project
droidforge init

# 2. Create your AI team (natural language analysis)
droidforge synthesize

# 3. Start using your new AI team!
factory droids list
factory droids use dev "Build a new feature"
```

 **Important**: After `droidforge synthesize`, use `factory` commands to interact with your droids.

##  Core Commands

### `droidforge init`
Initialize a new project by installing the global orchestrator and creating starter documentation.

```bash
droidforge init [--force]
```

**Options:**
- `--force`: Overwrite existing global orchestrator

**What it does:**
- Installs global orchestrator at `~/.droidforge/droids/orchestrator.md`
- Creates `AGENTS.md` with team overview
- Generates `docs/droid-guide.md` for team usage
- Creates `.droidforge/droids-manifest.json`

### `droidforge scan`
Analyze your repository to detect frameworks, scripts, and PRD content.

```bash
droidforge scan
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "signals": {
    "prdPaths": ["README.md", "docs/prd/prd.md"],
    "frameworks": ["react", "typescript"],
    "testConfigs": ["jest.config.js", "vitest.config.ts"],
    "prdContent": { ... }
  },
  "scripts": {
    "files": ["scripts/build.sh"],
    "npmScripts": [
      {"name": "build", "command": "tsc -p .", "path": "npm:build"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### `droidforge synthesize`
Generate droids based on interview, repository analysis, and PRD content.

```bash
droidforge synthesize [--dry-run] [--force] [--optimized]
```

**Options:**
- `--dry-run`: Preview changes without writing files
- `--force`: Skip interview confirmation prompts
- `--optimized`: Use faster scanning for large repositories

**Process:**
1. Conversational analysis (if project brief missing)
2. Repository scanning for frameworks and scripts
3. Domain-specific droid generation
4. Automatic conflict resolution
5. Documentation updates

### `droidforge add-script`
Wrap a specific script as a droid with least-privilege tools.

```bash
droidforge add-script <script-path> [--dry-run]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
droidforge add-script scripts/build.sh
droidforge add-script "npm:test"
droidforge add-script package.json#deploy
```

### `droidforge reanalyze`
Update existing droids based on repository changes.

```bash
droidforge reanalyze [--dry-run]
```

**What it does:**
- Updates project brief with latest intent
- Detects changes since last synthesis
- Proposes updates to existing droids
- Suggests new droids for new capabilities

##  Conversational Project Analysis

The synthesis process starts with an intelligent conversation where DroidForge acts as your technical analyst. The conversation continues until DroidForge has enough information to create the perfect specialized AI team for your project.

### How It Works
1. **Start the Conversation**: Describe your project in plain English
2. **Progressive Discovery**: DroidForge asks intelligent follow-up questions to understand your needs
3. **Technical Guidance**: Get personalized tech stack recommendations based on your experience level
4. **Perfect Understanding**: Conversation continues until deep understanding is achieved
5. **Smart Generation**: Creates specialized domain-specific droids based on your actual needs

### Example Conversations

**Dental Office App:**
```
Hello! I'm here to help you create the perfect AI team for your project.

What do you want to build?
> I want to build a web app for a dentist office

That's exciting! What's the biggest challenge you're trying to solve in your
dental practice right now?

> We keep losing appointments and patients call to cancel

Ah, appointment management! What's been most frustrating about how you handle
appointments now?

> We're still using a paper calendar

[Conversation continues with more specific questions...]
```
*Creates: `frontend-dental`, `backend-dental`, `scheduler-dental`*

**Restaurant System:**
```
> I need a restaurant ordering system

Excellent! What kind of restaurant service do you need most help with?
Taking orders, managing tables, kitchen display, or something else?

> Taking orders and table management

When customers come in, what's the most frustrating part of managing tables now?

> We get overwhelmed during peak hours...

[Conversation explores peak hour challenges, current workflow, etc...]
```
*Creates: `frontend-restaurant`, `backend-restaurant`*

**User with No Technical Experience:**
```
> I want to build a fitness app but I've never coded before

That's completely fine! Everyone starts somewhere. I'll make sure to set you up
with beginner-friendly tools. Are you more interested in building something that
works quickly (no-code/low-code) or are you excited to learn some coding?

> I want to learn coding

Great attitude! Since you're eager to learn, I'd recommend starting with something
like HTML/CSS/JavaScript. What sounds more exciting - web development or mobile?

[Conversation guides user toward appropriate learning path...]
```

### What DroidForge Discovers Through Conversation
- **Domain**: Medical/dental, restaurant, fitness, e-commerce, education, finance, etc.
- **Pain Points**: Current workflow problems and frustrations to solve
- **Requirements**: Features that will actually solve your problems
- **Technical Comfort**: Your experience level and learning preferences
- **Complexity**: Project scope based on real requirements, not assumptions
- **Tech Stack**: Personalized recommendations matching your goals and experience

##  Working with Droids

### Using Factory CLI
Once droids are generated, use them via Factory CLI:

```bash
# List available droids
factory droids list

# Use a specific droid
factory droids use dev "Implement user authentication"

# Chat with specialized droid
factory droids use ui-ux "Design login form"

# Execute script droid
factory droids use script-build "Build the application"
```

### Droid Orchestration
The global orchestrator manages team coordination:

```bash
# Let orchestrator coordinate task
factory orchestrator "Add user authentication system"

# Orchestrator will:
# 1. Break down task into sub-tasks
# 2. Assign appropriate droids
# 3. Coordinate handoffs
# 4. Ensure quality standards
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

After synthesis, your project structure includes:

```

##  Performance Features

### Optimized Scanning
For large repositories, use the `--optimized` flag:

```bash
droidforge synthesize --optimized
```

**Optimizations:**
- Parallel file processing
- Cached scanning results
- Incremental updates
- Smart pattern matching

### Caching
DroidForge maintains intelligent caches for:
- Repository scan results
- Framework detection
- Script analysis
- PRD parsing

Cache is automatically invalidated when files change.

##  Advanced Usage

### Custom Droid Patterns
Influence droid creation through your project brief:

```yaml
signals:
  custom_patterns:
    - name: "microservices"
      droids: ["api-gateway", "service-auth", "service-users"]
    - name: "data-heavy"
      droids: ["data-engineer", "ml-specialist", "performance-optimizer"]
```

### Conflict Resolution
When droids have overlapping responsibilities, DroidForge:

1. **Detects Conflicts**: Identifies pattern overlaps
2. **Proposes Resolutions**: Suggests strategies (merge, prioritize, split)
3. **Human Review**: Requires confirmation for changes
4. **Implements Solution**: Applies resolution strategy

### Integration with CI/CD
Include droid updates in your workflow:

```bash
# Update droids on major changes
droidforge reanalyze --dry-run
# Review changes, then:
droidforge reanalyze

# Regenerate documentation
factory droids list --docs > docs/current-team.md
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **"Missing project brief"**
```bash
# Run natural language analysis to create project brief
droidforge synthesize
```

#### **"Conflicts detected"**
```bash
# Review conflict report
droidforge synthesize --dry-run
# Conflicts will be shown with resolution suggestions
```

#### **"Droid generation failed"**
```bash
# Check repository structure
droidforge scan
# Ensure project has recognizable patterns
```

### Debug Mode
Use verbose logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
DEBUG=droidforge:* droidforge synthesize
```

### Reset and Recovery
```bash
# Clear cache (if issues persist)
rm -rf .droidforge/cache

# Regenerate all droids
droidforge init --force
droidforge synthesize --force
```
