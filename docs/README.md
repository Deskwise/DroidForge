# DroidForge Documentation (Active Set)

**Authoritative docs live here.** Everything else has moved to `docs/_archive_legacy/` and is considered stale—agents must ignore that folder unless explicitly told otherwise.

## Critical References
- [`docs/SPEC-METHODOLOGY-RECOMMENDATIONS.md`](SPEC-METHODOLOGY-RECOMMENDATIONS.md) — Pattern-matching ban + methodology guidance.
- [`docs/specifications/INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-NEW-AGENT.md`](specifications/INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-NEW-AGENT.md) — Onboarding instructions for implementers.
- [`docs/specifications/implementation-plan.md`](specifications/implementation-plan.md) — Current engineering roadmap.
- [`docs/specifications/onboarding-spec.md`](specifications/onboarding-spec.md) — UX contract for onboarding.

## Working Rules
- **Do not read** anything under `docs/_archive_legacy/` without explicit approval.
- Specs here override conflicting statements in archived material.
- Keep new documentation in this top-level set; archive older snapshots instead of editing in place.
