# Droid Guide

## Introduction

The Factory droid system provides autonomous agents for software development tasks. Droids are interactive agents that can read, analyze, and modify code based on their defined roles and scopes.

### Key Concepts
- **Droids**: Autonomous agents with specific roles (planner, dev, reviewer, qa, etc.)
- **Factory CLI**: Command-line interface for running droids
- **Scope**: Defines what files and operations a droid can access
- **Proof**: Validation commands that verify droid actions
- **Autonomy Levels**: L1 (confirmations), L2 (batch confirmations), L3 (fully autonomous)

- Global orchestrator installed at ~/.factory/droids/orchestrator.md

> No droids found. Run `factory init` to bootstrap the system.
