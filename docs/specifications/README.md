# Specifications

**Design specifications and requirements for implementation**

Specifications define what needs to be built and how it should work. These documents guide implementation and ensure features meet requirements.

## Available Specifications

- `onboarding-spec.md` - User experience specification for onboarding
- `ux-spec.md` - Complete UX specification for DroidForge
- `implementation-plan.md` - Detailed implementation plan for features
- `security.md` - Security requirements and review

## For Specification Writers

- Be clear and unambiguous
- Define requirements, not implementation
- Include success criteria
- Provide examples of expected behavior
- Keep separate from actual implementation notes
- Update when requirements change
