# Explanation

**Understanding-oriented documentation for concepts and design**

Explanation documentation helps you understand how DroidForge works, why it's designed the way it is, and the concepts behind the implementation. Read these to gain deeper knowledge.

## Available Explanations

- `architecture.md` - System design and technical architecture
- `team-coordination.md` - How droid team coordination works
- `onboarding-system.md` - The 10-data-point collection system explained
- `methodology-selection.md` - Why AI-powered, not pattern matching
- `design-decisions.md` - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## For Explanation Writers

- Focus on understanding, not doing
- Explain the "why" behind decisions
- Provide context and background
- Connect concepts together
- Use diagrams where helpful
- Don't include step-by-step instructions (use guides for that)
