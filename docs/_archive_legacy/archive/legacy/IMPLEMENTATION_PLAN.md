# DroidForge UX Redesign - Implementation Plan

**Based on:** `UX_SPEC.md`  
**Approach:** Small, sequential, independently testable steps  
**Each step:** Can be done in 30-60 minutes max  

**Status:** Phase 0-2 Complete, Phase 3 In Progress

---

## Phase 0: Foundation (Fix Architecture)

### Step 0.1: Implement Option A+ (Single Active Session) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Fixed forgeRoster.ts to use `loadActive()` when no sessionId provided
- Updated error message to be user-friendly (no technical details)
- Updated logging to use `session.sessionId` instead of input `sessionId`

**Result:** forgeRoster now works without sessionId parameter

---

### Step 0.2: Update Command Template (Remove SessionId References) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Removed all sessionId capture/passing instructions from `/forge-start` command template
- Updated guidance to rely on system-managed active session

**Result:** AI no longer needs to track sessionId manually

---

## Phase 1: Conversational Language

### Step 1.1: Rewrite Gate 1‚Üí2 Transition ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Removed duplicate prompts in onboarding.ts
- Created single conversational "What are you building?" prompt
- Added 4 diverse examples showing range of possible responses

**Result:** Cleaner, more natural transition from repo scan to project discovery

---

### Step 1.2: Rewrite Methodology Prompt (Add Examples) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Added example responses to methodology selection prompt
- Updated methodology list generation to work with Record structure

**Result:** Users see examples of how to respond (numbers, names, delegation)

---

### Step 1.3: Update Success Messages (Remove System Language) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Updated all assistant "say" segments to use conversational language
- Replaced technical confirmations with friendly acknowledgments
- Removed system-y phrases throughout onboarding flow

**Result:** Conversation feels like talking to a friend, not a system

---

## Phase 2: Methodology Visibility

### Step 2.1: Create Methodology-to-Role Mapping ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Created `src/mcp/generation/methodologyRoles.ts` with Record structure (not Array)
- Added all 10 methodologies with specific role names and outcome-focused purposes
- Examples: TDD ‚Üí "Test-First Lead", Agile ‚Üí "Sprint Coordinator"

**Result:** First droid role always reflects chosen methodology

---

### Step 2.2: Inject Methodology Role into Suggestions ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Ensured `buildSuggestions()` prepends a methodology-specific droid whose label and summary come from `METHODOLOGY_ROLES`
- Defaults to Agile when no methodology is stored so the first suggestion is always populated
- Retained `df-` slug prefix (`df-${methodology}-lead`) so droid files stay consistent with existing naming

**Result:** Methodology-specific lead is always the first suggestion, reflecting the chosen approach (e.g., Agile ‚Üí Sprint Coordinator, TDD ‚Üí Test-First Lead)

---

### Step 2.3: Update Droid Naming in Generation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Removed universal methodology prefixing for ALL droids
- Only methodology-specific droid (first one) has methodology in name
- Removed `normalizeIdWithMethodology()` function entirely
- Other droids keep their standard names (df-architect, df-tester, etc.)

**Result:** Methodology visible in ONE droid only, not all of them

---

## Phase 3: Flexible Input

### Step 3.1: Update Methodology Type Definition ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Confirmed `MethodologyChoice` already covers all supported selections, including `none`/`other` fallbacks
- Synced methodology role purposes with outcome-focused language so the type is represented consistently in suggestions and commands

**Result:** Methodologies remain centrally defined with user-friendly purposes that power both suggestion text and command templates

---

### Step 3.2: Add Methodology Descriptions to Command ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Updated `src/mcp/templates/commands.ts` to list every methodology with plain-language outcomes
- Added `df` command template with clear routing instructions to the orchestrator
- Removed meta "no emoji" disclaimers while keeping the actual text emoji-free

**Result:** Command templates now describe methodologies in conversational, outcome-focused terms and expose the orchestrator entry point

---

### Step 3.3: Add Top 3 Recommendation Logic ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Embedded guidance in the `/forge-start` command to recommend the top three methodologies based on SMART_SCAN signals and project goals
- Provided concrete pairing examples (e.g., Games ‚Üí TDD/Rapid/Agile, SaaS ‚Üí Agile/Lean/Enterprise)
- Directed the AI to explain why each recommendation fits before collecting the user's choice

**Result:** Onboarding now nudges the AI to provide contextual recommendations, making methodology selection easier for users

---

## Phase 4: Error Handling

### Step 4.1: Replace Technical Error Messages ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Updated forgeRoster.ts error to be user-friendly
- Changed from technical details to actionable guidance
- Error now says "No active onboarding session found. Please run /forge-start first."

---

### Step 4.2: Add Graceful Degradation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Updated the stdio server error handler to log stack traces privately while returning a friendly recovery hint to users
- Ensured `/forge-start` is surfaced as the reset path instead of exposing raw error details
- Rebuilt and ran the test suite to confirm no regressions

**Result:** Tool failures now guide users to restart onboarding without leaking technical error messages

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Test

### Step 5.1: Remove "No Emojis" Disclaimers ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Stripped meta disclaimers from the onboarding prompt and command templates
- Reviewed text to ensure it remains emoji-free without calling attention to the constraint
- Verified builds and tests after cleanup

**Result:** Copy reads naturally while still respecting the "no emoji" policy

---

### Step 5.2: End-to-End Test ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Exercised the onboarding prompt runner in tests to cover the full SMART_SCAN ‚Üí methodology selection ‚Üí roster forging ‚Üí guide installation flow
- Confirmed the manifest contains the methodology-specific lead role and that all droid files are generated in both `.factory` and `.droidforge`
- Ran `npm test` to validate the integration scenario mirrors the expected user journey

**Result:** Automated end-to-end coverage ensures the conversational onboarding path completes without sessionId issues and yields the correct roster

---

### Step 5.3: Test Edge Cases ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Tightened command guidance so the AI knows how to respond when users delegate the decision or provide vague inputs (‚Äúidk what to build‚Äù, ‚Äúyou decide‚Äù, etc.)
- Expanded methodology examples and recommendation rules to steer the assistant toward sensible defaults when the user asks for ‚Äúthe fastest methodology‚Äù or similar
- Validated via integration tests that flexible inputs (numbers, names, natural language) flow through without errors

**Result:** Edge-case prompts are now handled through clearer instructions, and automated tests confirm the tooling remains stable with flexible user input

---

## Phase 6: Documentation & Release

### Step 6.1: Update CHANGELOG ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Added the 2.0.0 release entry summarizing conversational onboarding, methodology visibility, and flexible input support
- Highlighted key fixes, including user-friendly error messaging and removal of sessionId handling from commands

**Result:** Changelog now documents the UX redesign and its impact ahead of release

---

### Step 6.2: Update README with New Flow ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What was done:**
- Refreshed the Quick Start section to highlight the conversational `/forge-start` experience
- Added an example dialog showing methodology recommendations and the resulting specialist roster
- Clarified `/df` usage as the follow-up command after onboarding

**Result:** README now reflects the redesigned UX with a concrete conversation example

---

### Step 6.3: Publish Release ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED
**Status:** Requires npm credentials and git push access.
**Next Steps for Maintainer:**
1. Run `npm version major` (to set 2.0.0)
2. Run `npm run build && npm test`
3. `npm publish`
4. `git tag v2.0.0 && git push --tags`

**Note:** Local build and test have already been executed; publishing must happen from an authorized environment.
- [ ] All tests passing

## Summary

**Total Steps:** 18  
**Estimated Time:** 10-15 hours  
**Can be done:** One step at a time, any order within phases  
**Each step:** Independently testable  

**Completed:** 10 steps (Phases 0, 1, 2, and part of 3, 4)  
**Remaining:** 8 steps (Phase 3 and Phase 4)  

**Critical Path:**
1. ‚úÖ Phase 0 (fix architecture) ‚Üí enables everything else
2. ‚úÖ Phase 1 (conversational) ‚Üí improves UX  
3. ‚úÖ Phase 2 (methodology visibility) ‚Üí core feature
4. üîÑ Phase 3 (flexible input) ‚Üí handles edge cases
5. ‚úÖ Phase 4 (errors) ‚Üí polish
6. üîÑ Phase 5 (test) ‚Üí verify
7. üîÑ Phase 6 (ship) ‚Üí release

**Key Issues Fixed During Implementation:**
- Architecture now uses Record instead of Array for methodology roles (performance)
- Removed universal methodology prefixing (was incorrectly prefixing ALL droids)
- Fixed duplicate prompts in onboarding flow
- Made error messages user-friendly
- Build system updated for new Record structure

**Each step should take 30-60 minutes max. If longer, break it down further.

## Implementation Notes

**Critical Lessons Learned:**
- Check agent work before proceeding (found multiple implementation errors)
- Record structure better than Array for methodology roles (performance)
- Only ONE droid should reflect methodology, not ALL of them
- Error messages must be user-friendly, never expose internals
- Test integration points after each phase**
