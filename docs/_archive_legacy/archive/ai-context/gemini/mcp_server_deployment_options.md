# Advisory Document: DroidForge MCP Server Deployment

This document outlines the research and recommendations for hosting the DroidForge MCP server, which is a standard Node.js application.

## Executive Summary

The DroidForge MCP server can be deployed on any modern cloud infrastructure that supports Node.js. The choice of hosting depends on your desired level of control, scalability, and operational overhead. For a balance of ease-of-use and power, a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** is the recommended starting point.

Once deployed, you will get a public URL for your MCP server. You will then use the `droid` CLI command `/mcp add droidforge <your-server-url>` to make it available for use.

## Hosting Options

There are three primary strategies for deploying a Node.js application like the DroidForge server:

### 1. Platform as a Service (PaaS)

*   **What it is:** A cloud computing model where a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools to users over the internet. You provide the code, and the platform handles the rest (deployment, scaling, networking).
*   **Examples:** Vercel, Render, Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Easy to Use:** Simple `git push` deployments.
    *   **Managed Infrastructure:** The provider handles servers, security, and scaling.
    *   **Fast Deployment:** Ideal for rapid iteration and getting to production quickly.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Less Control:** You have limited access to the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Cost:** Can become more expensive than a VPS as your application scales.

### 2. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) / Virtual Private Server (VPS)

*   **What it is:** You rent virtual servers from a cloud provider. You are responsible for managing the entire software stack, from the operating system up to your application.
*   **Examples:** DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Full Control:** Complete control over the server environment.
    *   **Cost-Effective:** Generally cheaper for high-traffic applications.
    *   **Flexible:** You can install any software you need.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **High Responsibility:** You are responsible for all setup, maintenance, security, and updates.
    *   **Complex Setup:** Requires knowledge of server administration, networking, and security.

### 3. Containerization (Docker & Kubernetes)

*   **What it is:** You package your application and its dependencies into a container (using Docker), which can then be run on any machine. Kubernetes is a tool for orchestrating (managing, scaling, and deploying) these containers.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Scalable & Portable:** Containers can be easily moved between different cloud providers.
    *   **Consistent Environments:** Ensures your application runs the same way in development and production.
    *   **Robust:** Kubernetes provides self-healing and high-availability features.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Steep Learning Curve:** Docker and especially Kubernetes can be complex to learn and manage.
    *   **Overkill for Small Projects:** Can be overly complex for simple applications.

## Key Considerations for DroidForge

*   **Stateless Nature:** The DroidForge server appears to be mostly stateless, which makes it an excellent candidate for PaaS and containerized environments where instances can be easily created and destroyed.
*   **Real-time Communication:** The MCP protocol may rely on WebSockets for real-time communication. All modern PaaS and VPS providers support WebSockets.
*   **Domain Name (`droidforge.team`):** Once you have chosen a hosting provider and deployed the server, you will need to configure the DNS records for `droidforge.team` to point to the IP address or hostname provided by your host.

## Recommendation

For the initial deployment of the DroidForge MCP server, I recommend starting with a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** provider like **Vercel** or **Render**.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Speed and Simplicity:** You can connect your GitHub repository and deploy the server in minutes, allowing you to focus on development rather than infrastructure.
*   **Scalability:** These platforms can automatically scale your application as usage grows.
*   **Future-Proof:** If you outgrow the PaaS, you can always migrate to a VPS or Kubernetes-based setup later. The initial development velocity gained from using a PaaS is invaluable.

## Next Steps

1.  **Choose a PaaS Provider:** I recommend exploring Vercel and Render.
2.  **Create an Account:** Sign up for an account with your chosen provider.
3.  **Connect Your Repository:** Connect the DroidForge GitHub repository to the provider.
4.  **Configure Deployment:** Configure the build command (`npm run build`) and the start command (`npm start` or `node dist/mcp/server.js`).
5.  **Deploy:** Trigger a deployment.
6.  **Configure DNS:** Point your `droidforge.team` domain to the new deployment.

This approach will get your MCP server live and accessible to `factory.ai` in the most efficient manner.
