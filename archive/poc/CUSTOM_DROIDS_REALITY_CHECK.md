# ⚠️ Custom Droids Reality Check

## The Truth About Parallel Execution

Based on Factory.ai official documentation, here's what **actually happens**:

### ❌ Custom Droids Do NOT Run Simultaneously

**From the docs:**
> "Each subagent runs with a fresh context window"
> "The Task tool streams live progress as the subagent executes"
> "Invoke via the Task tool when custom droids are enabled"

**What this means:**
- Custom droids are **invoked one at a time** via the **Task tool**
- They run **sequentially**, not in parallel
- Each droid finishes before the next one starts
- They're **subagents** that the main droid spawns and waits for

### 🤔 What About "Massively Parallel"?

The marketing mentions **"spawn hundreds of agents"** and **"massively parallel execution"** but that's referring to:
- **`droid exec` (Headless CLI)** - for batch operations in CI/CD
- **Multiple separate terminal sessions** - running different `droid` instances
- **NOT** custom droids running simultaneously within one session

## 📊 What Factory.ai Custom Droids Actually Do

### Real Use Case: Sequential Delegation

```
You → Main Droid
      ↓
      Calls Task tool with @CodeReviewer
      [Waits for CodeReviewer to finish]
      ↓
      Calls Task tool with @SecurityChecker  
      [Waits for SecurityChecker to finish]
      ↓
      Returns combined results
```

### Benefits (Still Useful!)
- ✅ **Reusable prompts** - encode complex instructions once
- ✅ **Tool restrictions** - limit subagents to safe operations
- ✅ **Context isolation** - fresh context window per subagent
- ✅ **Model flexibility** - use different models per task
- ✅ **Live progress** - see TodoWrite updates in real-time

### Limitations
- ❌ **Not parallel** - subagents run one after another
- ❌ **No true concurrency** - can't have 4 droids working simultaneously
- ❌ **Sequential blocking** - main droid waits for each subagent

## 🚀 True Parallel Options

If you want **actual parallelism**, here are the real options:

### Option 1: Multiple Terminal Sessions (Manual Parallelism)
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd DroidForge
droid "Implement Phase 1 synchronization"

# Terminal 2 (separate instance)
cd DroidForge  
droid "Implement Phase 5 staging isolation"

# Terminal 3
cd DroidForge
droid "Implement Phase 6 event bus"

# Terminal 4
cd DroidForge
droid "Write tests for all phases"
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ True parallelism (4 droids working simultaneously)
- ✅ Each has full tool access
- ✅ Simple to understand

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ You manually coordinate between terminals
- ⚠️ Git conflicts if they touch same files
- ⚠️ No automatic coordination files

### Option 2: `droid exec` with Scripts (CI/CD Style)
```bash
# Create task files
echo "Implement Phase 1" > task1.txt
echo "Implement Phase 5" > task2.txt
echo "Implement Phase 6" > task3.txt
echo "Write tests" > task4.txt

# Run in parallel (if droid exec supports it)
droid exec - < task1.txt &
droid exec - < task2.txt &
droid exec - < task3.txt &
droid exec - < task4.txt &
wait
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Scriptable
- ✅ Can run in CI/CD

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ `droid exec` may still run sequentially (docs unclear)
- ⚠️ Less interactive
- ⚠️ Harder to debug

### Option 3: Single Droid with Strategic Task Batching
```
You: "Work on these 4 phases in sequence, but optimize by doing 
independent file operations where possible:
1. Phase 1 - create synchronization.ts
2. Phase 5 - create staging.ts (independent file)  
3. Phase 6 - create eventBus.ts (independent file)
4. Phase 7 - create resourceMatcher.ts (independent file)

After creating all 4 files, integrate them one by one."
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ One conversation
- ✅ Droid optimizes internally
- ✅ No coordination overhead

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Not true parallelism
- ⚠️ Still sequential execution
- ⚠️ Takes 6 weeks instead of 2.5

## 💡 My Recommendation

Given the reality of how Custom Droids work, here's the best strategy:

### Hybrid Approach: Manual Parallelism + Coordination Files

1. **Create coordination files** (I'll do this):
   - `PROGRESS.md` - track overall status
   - `INTERFACES.md` - shared contracts
   - `FILE_OWNERSHIP.md` - prevent conflicts
   - `TODO_WS1.md`, `TODO_WS2.md`, etc. - task lists

2. **Open 2-4 terminal sessions** (you do this):
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Core work (critical path)
   droid "Read PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md Phases 1-4. 
   You are CoreDev. Follow FILE_OWNERSHIP.md. 
   Update TODO_WS1.md and PROGRESS.md as you work."
   
   # Terminal 2 - Isolation work
   droid "Read PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md Phase 5.
   You are IsolationDev. Follow FILE_OWNERSHIP.md.
   Update TODO_WS2.md and PROGRESS.md as you work."
   
   # Terminal 3 - Infrastructure work  
   droid "Read PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md Phases 6-7-9.
   You are InfraDev. Follow FILE_OWNERSHIP.md.
   Update TODO_WS3.md and PROGRESS.md as you work."
   
   # Terminal 4 - Testing work
   droid "Read PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md Phase 8.
   You are TestDev. Write tests for all phases.
   Update TODO_WS4.md and PROGRESS.md as you work."
   ```

3. **They coordinate via files**:
   - Each reads `INTERFACES.md` for contracts
   - Each updates their `TODO_WSx.md`
   - Each updates `PROGRESS.md` with status
   - You check `PROGRESS.md` to see overall status

4. **You orchestrate integration points**:
   ```bash
   # When both ready, in Terminal 1:
   "Integrate IsolationDev's staging.ts into your manager.ts"
   ```

### Timeline with This Approach
- **With 4 terminals:** ~2.5 weeks (true parallelism)
- **With 2 terminals:** ~3 weeks  
- **With 1 terminal:** ~4 weeks (sequential batching)

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Custom Droids (@mentions) are NOT for parallel execution.**

They're for:
- Reusable specialized tasks
- Sequential delegation
- Context isolation
- Tool restriction

**For true parallelism, you need multiple `droid` instances** (separate terminals or `droid exec` processes).

---

## Next Steps

Pick your approach:

**A) Manual parallelism (fastest - 2.5 weeks)**
```
"Create coordination files, then I'll open 4 terminals 
and start 4 droids working in parallel"
```

**B) Hybrid (2 terminals - 3 weeks)**
```
"Create coordination files, I'll run 2 droids in parallel"
```

**C) Single droid (simplest - 4 weeks)**
```
"Just work with me in this session, we'll batch tasks strategically"
```

**D) Learn more about droid exec**
```
"Can we use droid exec to run multiple droids truly in parallel?"
```

Which one?
