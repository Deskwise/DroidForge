# üöÄ Droid Exec Parallel Automation Strategy

## ‚úÖ YES! You Can Brute-Force Parallelism with `droid exec`

Based on official Factory.ai documentation, **`droid exec` is specifically designed for batch and parallel patterns!**

---

## üìã What `droid exec` Provides

### Key Features for Parallelism
- **Headless execution** - runs in background, no UI needed
- **Non-interactive** - one-shot command that exits when done
- **Composable** - designed for shell scripting and parallel execution
- **Multiple instances** - can spawn many simultaneously
- **Structured output** - JSON for parsing results

### Official Parallel Patterns from Docs

The documentation explicitly shows parallel execution patterns:

```bash
# Process files in parallel (GNU xargs -P)
find src -name "*.ts" -print0 | xargs -0 -P 4 -I {} \
  droid exec --auto low "Refactor file: {} to use modern TS patterns"

# Background job parallelization
for path in packages/ui packages/models apps/factory-app; do
  (
    cd "$path" &&
    droid exec --auto low "Run targeted analysis and write report.md"
  ) &
done
wait  # Wait for all background jobs to complete
```

---

## üéØ Our Parallelization Strategy

### Approach: Automated Parallel Execution Script

I'll create a bash script that:
1. Spawns 4 separate `droid exec` processes in background
2. Each works on a different workstream (Phases 1-4, 5, 6-7-9, 8)
3. They coordinate through shared files (PROGRESS.md, INTERFACES.md)
4. Script waits for all to complete
5. Aggregates results

### Script Structure

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# parallel-droids.sh

export FACTORY_API_KEY="${FACTORY_API_KEY}"
cd /home/richard/code/DroidForge

# Function to run a workstream
run_workstream() {
    local name=$1
    local phases=$2
    local files=$3
    local todo=$4
    
    droid exec --auto medium \
        --output-format json \
        --cwd /home/richard/code/DroidForge \
        "You are ${name}. 
        
        READ FIRST:
        - PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md (${phases})
        - INTERFACES.md (contracts you must follow)
        - FILE_OWNERSHIP.md (your assigned files)
        
        YOUR FILES: ${files}
        YOUR TODO: ${todo}
        
        RULES:
        1. Only modify files in YOUR FILES list
        2. Follow all interfaces defined in INTERFACES.md
        3. Update ${todo} after each completed task
        4. Update PROGRESS.md when you finish major milestones
        5. Write tests for all code
        6. Use TypeScript strict mode
        
        TASK: Implement all phases assigned to you. Work through your TODO list systematically." \
        > logs/${name}.json 2>&1 &
    
    echo $!  # Return process ID
}

# Start all 4 workstreams in parallel
echo "Starting parallel droid execution..."

pid1=$(run_workstream \
    "CoreDev" \
    "Phases 1-4" \
    "manager.ts, synchronization.ts, resourceLocks.ts, deadlockDetector.ts, persistence.ts" \
    "TODO_WS1.md")

pid2=$(run_workstream \
    "IsolationDev" \
    "Phase 5" \
    "staging.ts, merger.ts" \
    "TODO_WS2.md")

pid3=$(run_workstream \
    "InfraDev" \
    "Phases 6, 7, 9" \
    "eventBus.ts, resourceMatcher.ts, metrics.ts, healthCheck.ts" \
    "TODO_WS3.md")

pid4=$(run_workstream \
    "TestDev" \
    "Phase 8" \
    "__tests__/*.test.ts" \
    "TODO_WS4.md")

# Monitor progress
echo "CoreDev: PID $pid1"
echo "IsolationDev: PID $pid2"
echo "InfraDev: PID $pid3"
echo "TestDev: PID $pid4"

# Wait for all to complete
wait $pid1 $pid2 $pid3 $pid4

echo "All droids completed!"
echo "Check PROGRESS.md for final status"
```

## üîß Autonomy Levels for Our Use Case

### Recommended: `--auto medium`

Perfect for our development work:
- ‚úÖ Installing packages (async-mutex)
- ‚úÖ Running tests (npm test)
- ‚úÖ Building code (npm run build)
- ‚úÖ Git operations (commit, but not push)
- ‚ùå No git push (we control that)
- ‚ùå No sudo or system changes

### Alternative: `--auto low` (safer, but may block)

If you want more control:
- ‚úÖ File creation/editing
- ‚ùå No package installs (we'd need to do manually)
- ‚ùå No npm test (we'd run separately)

### Avoid: `--auto high` or `--skip-permissions-unsafe`

Too risky for development work - could push to git or make destructive changes.

## üìä Expected Timeline with This Approach

### With 4 Parallel `droid exec` Processes

| Metric | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| **Setup time** | 1 hour (create coordination files, test script) |
| **Execution time** | 2-3 days (droids work autonomously) |
| **Integration time** | 0.5-1 day (merge + test) |
| **Total** | **3-4 days** (vs 2.5 weeks manual) |

### Why So Fast?

- **No human bottleneck** - droids work 24/7
- **True parallelism** - 4 processes simultaneously
- **Automated coordination** - file-based sync
- **No context switching** - each droid stays focused

---

## üéÆ Monitoring & Control

### Real-Time Progress Tracking

```bash
# Watch all droid logs in real-time
tail -f logs/*.json

# Check overall progress
watch -n 5 cat PROGRESS.md

# See what files are being modified
watch -n 10 git status

# Monitor CPU/memory usage
htop  # All 4 droid processes visible
```

### Stopping/Pausing

```bash
# Graceful stop (Ctrl+C in terminal where script runs)
# Or kill specific droid:
kill $pid1  # Stops CoreDev only

# Kill all droids
pkill -f "droid exec"

# Resume: Just re-run the script
# Droids will see existing TODO progress and continue
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### File Ownership Prevention
Each droid is explicitly told:
- "Only modify files in YOUR FILES list"
- If they try to edit others' files, it creates merge conflicts (easy to detect)

### Git Safety
- `--auto medium` doesn't allow `git push`
- All changes stay local until you review
- You control when to commit and push

### Test Gating
- Each droid writes tests
- Final integration step runs full test suite
- Nothing merges if tests fail

### Progress Checkpoints
- PROGRESS.md updated continuously
- TODO lists show completion status
- You can stop/review/resume anytime

---

## üìÅ Files I'll Create

### 1. Coordination Files (Before Starting)
```
INTERFACES.md            - TypeScript interface contracts
FILE_OWNERSHIP.md        - Strict file assignments per workstream
PROGRESS.md              - Real-time status tracker
TODO_WS1.md             - CoreDev checklist
TODO_WS2.md             - IsolationDev checklist
TODO_WS3.md             - InfraDev checklist
TODO_WS4.md             - TestDev checklist
```

### 2. Automation Script
```
parallel-droids.sh       - Main orchestration script
logs/                    - Output from each droid (JSON format)
```

### 3. Integration Script (After Completion)
```
integrate-droids.sh      - Merge all workstreams
  1. Run all tests
  2. Check for conflicts
  3. Verify interfaces match
  4. Create demo
```

---

## üéØ Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Setup (1 hour)
1. I create all coordination files
2. I create `parallel-droids.sh` script
3. You review and approve
4. Test with dry-run (read-only mode)

### Phase 2: Parallel Execution (2-3 days)
1. Run `./parallel-droids.sh`
2. Monitor via `watch cat PROGRESS.md`
3. Check logs occasionally for errors
4. Droids work autonomously

### Phase 3: Integration (0.5-1 day)
1. Review all changes (`git diff`)
2. Run integration tests
3. Fix any conflicts (likely minimal)
4. Merge and commit

### Phase 4: Validation (0.5 day)
1. Run full test suite
2. Test key scenarios manually
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Documentation review

## üö® Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Droid Gets Stuck
**Detection:** No updates to PROGRESS.md for 2+ hours
**Solution:** Kill that droid, check logs, restart with adjusted prompt

### Issue 2: File Conflicts
**Detection:** Git merge conflicts
**Solution:** Well-defined FILE_OWNERSHIP.md should prevent this
**Backup:** Manual merge, then re-run tests

### Issue 3: Interface Mismatch
**Detection:** Integration tests fail
**Solution:** One droid updates INTERFACES.md incorrectly
**Fix:** Revert interface change, adjust implementations

### Issue 4: Tests Fail
**Detection:** `npm test` returns errors
**Solution:** 
- Check which workstream's tests fail
- Re-run that droid with fixes
- Or manually fix (they're close!)

### Issue 5: API Rate Limits
**Detection:** Droid exec fails with rate limit error
**Solution:**
- Stagger start times (30 sec between each)
- Use `--model claude-haiku-4-5` (faster, cheaper)
- Add retry logic to script

---

## üí° Optimizations

### Use Cheaper/Faster Models
```bash
# Phase 8 (tests) can use Haiku (faster, cheaper)
droid exec --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 --auto medium "Write tests..."

# Critical path (Phases 1-4) uses Sonnet (more capable)
droid exec --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 --auto medium "Implement locks..."
```

### Staggered Starts
```bash
# Avoid all 4 droids hitting API at same instant
run_workstream "CoreDev" ... &
sleep 30
run_workstream "IsolationDev" ... &
sleep 30
run_workstream "InfraDev" ... &
sleep 30
run_workstream "TestDev" ... &
```

### Incremental Progress
```bash
# Break into smaller batches
# Day 1: Just Phase 1
# Day 2: Phases 2-3 (after Phase 1 works)
# Day 3: Phases 4-5-6
# Day 4: Phases 7-8-9
```

## üéâ Advantages Over Manual Terminals

| Approach | Speed | Coordination | Monitoring | Resumable |
|----------|-------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| **4 Manual Terminals** | 2.5 weeks | Manual | Switch tabs | Manual |
| **`droid exec` Script** | 3-4 days | Automated | Single view | Yes |

### Why Script is Better
- ‚úÖ **Faster** - No waiting for you between tasks
- ‚úÖ **Automated** - Set it and forget it
- ‚úÖ **Resumable** - Script tracks state
- ‚úÖ **Consistent** - Same prompts every run
- ‚úÖ **Logged** - JSON output for debugging
- ‚úÖ **Scalable** - Could do 10+ workstreams

---

## üöÄ Ready to Start?

### Option A: Full Automation (Recommended)
```
"Yes, create all coordination files and the parallel-droids.sh script. 
Let's automate this with droid exec!"
```

I'll:
1. Create INTERFACES.md, FILE_OWNERSHIP.md, PROGRESS.md, all TODOs
2. Create parallel-droids.sh with 4 parallel executions
3. Test with dry-run (--auto off for read-only preview)
4. You run it, monitor PROGRESS.md
5. 3-4 days later, we integrate and test!

### Option B: Hybrid (Some Automation)
```
"Create coordination files, but let me manually control when 
each workstream starts with droid exec commands"
```

I'll give you 4 separate commands you can run manually.

### Option C: Manual Terminals Still
```
"Actually, let's stick with 4 manual terminal sessions. 
Create coordination files for that approach."
```

**Which one? I strongly recommend Option A** - it's the fastest and most hands-off approach!
