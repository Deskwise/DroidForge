# ✅ TODO: Workstream 2 - Isolation & Merging (IsolationDev)

**Owner:** IsolationDev  
**Phase:** 5  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Phase 5: Staging Directory Isolation

### StagingManager Implementation

- [x] Create `src/mcp/execution/staging.ts`
  - [x] Import required modules (fs, path, glob)
  - [x] Define IStagingManager interface
  - [x] Implement StagingManager class
  - [x] Implement createStaging(repoRoot, executionId, nodeId)
    - [x] Create `.droidforge/exec/<id>/staging/<nodeId>/` directory
    - [x] Copy repo files (excluding .droidforge itself)
    - [x] Return staging path
  - [x] Implement collectChanges(repoRoot, stagingPath, resourceClaims)
    - [x] For each resource claim (glob pattern)
    - [x] Find matching files in staging
    - [x] Read file contents
    - [x] Return Map<relPath, content>
  - [x] Implement cleanStaging(repoRoot, executionId, nodeId)
    - [x] Remove staging directory
    - [x] Clean up empty parent dirs

### ExecutionMerger Implementation

- [x] Create `src/mcp/execution/merger.ts`
  - [x] Import required modules
  - [x] Define IExecutionMerger interface
  - [x] Define MergeResult interface
  - [x] Implement ExecutionMerger class
  - [x] Implement merge(repoRoot, executionId, completedNodes, stagingManager)
    - [x] Collect all changes from staging areas
    - [x] Group by file path
    - [x] Detect conflicts (multiple versions of same file)
    - [x] If no conflicts, apply changes atomically
    - [x] Create snapshot before merge (optional)
    - [x] Return MergeResult
  - [x] Implement detectConflicts(repoRoot, changes)
    - [x] Check if multiple nodes modified same file
    - [x] Compare content hashes
    - [x] Return list of conflicting files

### Integration with ExecutionManager

- [x] Update integration points
  - [x] CoreDev will call createStaging() in requestNext()
  - [x] CoreDev will call collectChanges() in completeNode()
  - [x] Merge happens via merge_execution tool
  - **Note:** Interfaces are defined and ready for CoreDev integration

---

## Testing

- [x] Write tests in `__tests__/staging.test.ts`
  - [x] Test staging directory creation
  - [x] Test copy-on-write isolation
  - [x] Test collectChanges with globs
  - [x] Test cleanup
- [x] Write tests in `__tests__/merger.test.ts`
  - [x] Test conflict detection
  - [x] Test clean merge (no conflicts)
  - [x] Test merge with conflicts
  - [x] Test atomic operations

**Test Results:**
- All 15 tests passing (8 staging + 7 merger)
- 100% test coverage for new code
- No lint errors

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] All tasks checked off
- [x] Tests passing (>85% coverage) - 100% for new code!
- [x] Staging directories fully isolated
- [x] Merge handles conflicts correctly
- [x] Only owned files modified (staging.ts, merger.ts, and their tests)
- [x] PROGRESS.md updated

## Implementation Summary

**Files Created:**
- `src/mcp/execution/staging.ts` - StagingManager implementation (143 lines)
- `src/mcp/execution/merger.ts` - ExecutionMerger implementation (165 lines)
- `src/mcp/execution/__tests__/staging.test.ts` - Comprehensive staging tests (170 lines)
- `src/mcp/execution/__tests__/merger.test.ts` - Comprehensive merger tests (223 lines)

**Key Features:**
- Isolated staging directories for each execution node
- Selective file copying (excludes .droidforge)
- Glob pattern support for resource claims
- SHA-256 based conflict detection
- Atomic file operations for safe merging
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full test coverage

**Dependencies Used:**
- globby (already installed) - for glob pattern matching
- Node.js built-in modules: fs, path, crypto

**Completion Date:** 2025-10-24
