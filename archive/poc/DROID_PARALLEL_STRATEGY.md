# ü§ñ DroidForge: Parallel Development with Droids

## Strategy: Spawn Multiple Droids to Work Simultaneously

Instead of multiple human developers, we'll spawn **4 specialized droids** in Droid CLI to work on independent workstreams in parallel, coordinating through shared files.

## üéØ How This Works in Droid CLI

### The Coordination Model

Droid 1         Droid 2         Droid 3      Droid 4
(Core)          (Isolation)     (Infra)      (Tests)
    ‚Üì               ‚Üì               ‚Üì            ‚Üì
Writes to:     Writes to:      Writes to:   Writes to:
manager.ts     staging.ts      eventBus.ts  *.test.ts
locks.ts       merger.ts       metrics.ts   
    ‚Üì               ‚Üì               ‚Üì            ‚Üì
All read from: INTERFACES.md (shared contract)
All update:    PROGRESS.md (coordination log)
```

**Key Insight:** Droids work on **different files** simultaneously, coordinating through:
1. **Shared interface contracts** (INTERFACES.md)
2. **Progress tracking** (PROGRESS.md)
3. **Todo checklists** (one per droid)
4. **Your orchestration** (you review & merge)

---

## üìã Setup Phase (You do this first)

### Step 1: Create Coordination Files

These files let droids work independently without conflicts:

```bash
# Create shared contract that all droids read
touch src/mcp/execution/INTERFACES.md

# Create progress tracker
touch PROGRESS.md

# Create todo lists per workstream
touch TODO_WS1_CORE.md
touch TODO_WS2_ISOLATION.md
touch TODO_WS3_INFRA.md
touch TODO_WS4_TESTS.md
```

### Step 2: Define Interface Contracts (Critical!)

I'll create this file with TypeScript interfaces that all droids must follow. This prevents integration conflicts later.

### Step 3: Assign Clear File Ownership

Create a file mapping so droids know their boundaries:

```markdown
# FILE_OWNERSHIP.md

## Workstream 1: Core Concurrency (Droid: CoreDev)
OWNS (can modify):
- src/mcp/execution/manager.ts
- src/mcp/execution/synchronization.ts
- src/mcp/execution/resourceLocks.ts
- src/mcp/execution/deadlockDetector.ts
- src/mcp/execution/persistence.ts

READS (must not modify):
- src/mcp/execution/INTERFACES.md
- All other execution/*.ts files

## Workstream 2: Isolation (Droid: IsolationDev)
OWNS:
- src/mcp/execution/staging.ts
- src/mcp/execution/merger.ts

READS:
- src/mcp/execution/INTERFACES.md
- src/mcp/execution/manager.ts (for integration points)

## Workstream 3: Infrastructure (Droid: InfraDev)
OWNS:
- src/mcp/execution/eventBus.ts
- src/mcp/execution/resourceMatcher.ts
- src/mcp/execution/metrics.ts
- src/mcp/execution/healthCheck.ts
- src/mcp/http-server.ts (add SSE endpoint)

READS:
- src/mcp/execution/INTERFACES.md

## Workstream 4: Tests (Droid: TestDev)
OWNS:
- src/mcp/execution/__tests__/*.test.ts
- New test files

READS:
- All src/mcp/execution/*.ts files
```

@CoreDroid Read PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md Phase 1-4. 
Implement synchronization for ExecutionManager. 
Follow interfaces in src/mcp/execution/INTERFACES.md.
Update TODO_WS1_CORE.md as you progress.
DO NOT modify files owned by other workstreams.

# Chat 2 - Isolation Droid
@IsolationDroid Read PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md Phase 5.
Implement staging directories and merger.
Follow interfaces in INTERFACES.md.
Update TODO_WS2_ISOLATION.md as you progress.

# Chat 3 - Infra Droid

---

## üîÑ Coordination Workflow

### Daily Cycle (You Orchestrate)

**Morning: Review Progress**
```bash
# Read what each droid accomplished
cat PROGRESS.md
cat TODO_WS1_CORE.md
cat TODO_WS2_ISOLATION.md
cat TODO_WS3_INFRA.md
cat TODO_WS4_TESTS.md
```

**During Day: Droids Work Independently**
Each droid:
1. Reads their todo list
2. Implements next task
3. Updates their todo when done
4. Updates PROGRESS.md with status
5. Commits code with clear message

**End of Day: Integration Check**
```bash
# Check for conflicts
git status

# Review completed work
git diff

# Test integration points
npm test

# Update main progress tracker
# Give droids feedback for tomorrow
```

### Integration Points (You Coordinate)

When two workstreams need to integrate:

```bash
# Example: Day 5 - Staging ‚Üí Manager integration

# 1. Confirm both sides ready
@CoreDroid Have you completed requestNext() implementation?
@IsolationDroid Have you completed StagingManager.createStaging()?

# 2. One droid integrates (or you do it)
@CoreDroid Integrate IsolationDroid's StagingManager into your requestNext().
Call stagingManager.createStaging() before returning the task.

# 3. Test together
npm test

# 4. Update progress
Both droids update PROGRESS.md with "‚úÖ Integration complete"
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Preventing Conflicts

### Strategy 1: File-Level Isolation
Each droid owns specific files. They NEVER edit each other's files.

### Strategy 2: Interface-First Development
All droids follow the contracts in INTERFACES.md. Integration happens through these stable interfaces.

### Strategy 3: Mock Implementations
Each droid creates a mock of dependencies they need:

```typescript
// CoreDroid creates this for their own testing
class MockStagingManager implements IStagingManager {
  async createStaging() { return '/tmp/mock'; }
}

// Later replaced with real one from IsolationDroid
```

### Strategy 4: Clear Communication
Droids announce when they're ready for integration:

```markdown
# In PROGRESS.md
[CoreDroid] ‚úÖ requestNext() ready for staging integration
[IsolationDroid] ‚úÖ StagingManager.createStaging() ready to integrate
[Orchestrator] üëç Proceed with integration
```

## üé¨ Getting Started Right Now

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **I'll create all coordination files** (INTERFACES.md, PROGRESS.md, todos, etc.)
2. **You spawn 4 droids** (or start 4 parallel chats)
3. **Give each droid their assignment** (copy from Option B above)
4. **Let them work** for 2-4 hours
5. **You review progress** via PROGRESS.md and git diff
6. **Coordinate integration points** when needed
7. **Merge completed work** as droids finish

### Example Kickoff Commands

```bash
# After I create the files...

# Give each droid their marching orders:

"CoreDroid: You are the concurrency expert. Read PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md
Phases 1-4. Implement synchronization for ExecutionManager following
INTERFACES.md. Update TODO_WS1_CORE.md and PROGRESS.md as you work.
Start with Phase 1: Add async-mutex and wrap all methods."

"IsolationDroid: You are the filesystem expert. Read PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md
Phase 5. Implement staging directories and merger. Follow INTERFACES.md.
Update TODO_WS2_ISOLATION.md and PROGRESS.md. Start with StagingManager."

"InfraDroid: You are the infrastructure expert. Read PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md
Phases 6, 7, 9. Implement event bus, resource matching, and observability.
Update TODO_WS3_INFRA.md and PROGRESS.md. Start with EventBus."

"TestDroid: You are the QA expert. Read PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md Phase 8.
Write comprehensive tests for all workstreams. Update TODO_WS4_TESTS.md.
Start with concurrency stress tests."
```

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

**You'll know it's working when:**
- ‚úÖ Each droid updates their TODO file after completing tasks
- ‚úÖ PROGRESS.md shows parallel advancement across workstreams
- ‚úÖ `git status` shows 4+ files modified simultaneously
- ‚úÖ No merge conflicts (because files are isolated)
- ‚úÖ Integration happens smoothly at designated points
- ‚úÖ Tests pass as droids complete their work

---

## üöÄ Ready to Start?

Say **"Yes, create the coordination files"** and I'll generate:
1. INTERFACES.md with TypeScript contracts
2. PROGRESS.md with tracking structure
3. FILE_OWNERSHIP.md with clear boundaries
4. All 4 TODO_WS*.md files with detailed tasks
5. Initial coordination instructions

Then you can spawn your droids and watch them work in parallel! ü§ñü§ñü§ñü§ñ
