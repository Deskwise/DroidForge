  - [x] Define HealthStatus interface
  - [x] Implement HealthChecker class
  - [x] Implement check(manager) method
    - [x] Count active/paused executions
    - [x] Detect stalled executions (>5min no updates)
    - [x] Check memory usage
    - [x] Return HealthStatus

### HTTP Endpoints

- [x] Update `src/mcp/http-server.ts`
  - [x] Add SSE endpoint: GET /api/executions/:id/stream
  - [x] Add metrics endpoint: GET /api/metrics
  - [x] Add health endpoint: GET /api/health
  - [x] Add debug endpoint: GET /api/executions/:id/debug

---

## Testing

- [x] Write tests in `__tests__/metrics.test.ts`
- [x] Write tests in `__tests__/healthCheck.test.ts`

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] All tasks checked off
- [x] Tests passing (>85% coverage) - 74/74 tests pass
- [x] Events emit correctly
- [x] Resource matching works
- [x] Metrics track accurately
- [x] Only owned files modified
- [x] PROGRESS.md updated

## Summary

All Phase 6, 7, and 9 tasks completed successfully:
- **EventBus**: Real-time event pub/sub system with execution filtering
- **ResourceMatcher**: Intelligent overlap detection with glob pattern support
- **MetricsCollector**: Performance tracking with concurrency monitoring
- **HealthChecker**: System health monitoring with stalled execution detection
- **HTTP Endpoints**: SSE streaming, metrics, health check, and debug endpoints
- **Test Coverage**: 74 tests, all passing with comprehensive coverage
