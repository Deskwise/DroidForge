# üìö Documentation Creation Order

## What Should We Create First?

### Recommended Order:

1. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)** ‚Üê START HERE
   - What problem does this solve?
   - Who are the users?
   - What are the requirements?
   - What does success look like?
   - User stories and scenarios

2. **Technical Specification**
   - How does it work architecturally?
   - What are the components?
   - API contracts and interfaces
   - Data structures
   - Implementation details

3. **Implementation Plan**
   - Phases breakdown
   - Task decomposition
   - Dependencies
   - Timeline estimates

4. **API Documentation**
   - Tool definitions
   - Prompt formats
   - Response schemas

## Why PRD First?

### PRD Validates:
- ‚úÖ Is this problem worth solving?
- ‚úÖ Who will use this?
- ‚úÖ What are the must-have vs nice-to-have features?
- ‚úÖ How do we measure success?
- ‚úÖ What are the risks/assumptions?

### PRD Prevents:
- ‚ùå Building the wrong thing
- ‚ùå Over-engineering solutions
- ‚ùå Missing critical requirements
- ‚ùå Unclear success criteria

### Technical Spec After PRD Because:
- You can't design HOW until you know WHAT
- PRD defines constraints that inform technical decisions
- Easier to change PRD than rewrite technical implementation

## What Each Document Contains

### PRD (Product Requirements Document)
```
1. Executive Summary
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Key benefits

2. User Personas & Use Cases
   - Who uses this?
   - What are their pain points?
   - How does this help them?

3. Requirements
   - Must-have (P0)
   - Should-have (P1)
   - Nice-to-have (P2)

4. User Stories
   - "As a developer, I want to..."
   - Acceptance criteria

5. Success Metrics
   - How do we measure success?
   - KPIs

6. Risks & Mitigations
   - What could go wrong?
   - How do we handle it?

7. Timeline & Milestones
   - High-level phases
   - Key deliverables
```

### Technical Specification
```
1. Architecture Overview
   - System components
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Integration points

2. Core Components
   - ExecutionManager
   - ResourceLockManager
   - StagingManager
   - EventBus
   - etc.

3. API Contracts
   - Tool definitions
   - Input/output schemas
   - Error handling

4. Data Models
   - Execution state
   - Node definitions
   - Lock structures

5. Algorithms
   - Task scheduling
   - Deadlock detection
   - Conflict resolution

6. Security & Safety
   - Permission models
   - Isolation strategies
   - Failure modes

7. Performance Considerations
   - Scalability limits
   - Optimization strategies
   - Benchmarks
```

## Decision: Create PRD First

**Recommended:** Start with PRD to validate the product vision, then write technical spec based on validated requirements.

**Next Step:** Create comprehensive PRD for DroidForge Parallel Orchestration
