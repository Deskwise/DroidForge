This directory contains historical documentation from previous development phases. These files are preserved for reference but are **not part of the current system**.

## What's Here

### `/poc/` - Parallel Orchestration Proof of Concept (Oct 2024)

Documentation and planning files from the parallel orchestration POC experiment:

  - `DROID_CLI_PARALLEL_STRATEGY.md`, `DROID_EXEC_PARALLEL_AUTOMATION.md`
  - `CUSTOM_DROIDS_REALITY_CHECK.md`, `FACTORY_CUSTOM_DROIDS_SETUP.md`

- **Technical Plans:** Implementation roadmaps and feasibility analysis
  - `PARALLELIZATION_ROADMAP.md` - 9-phase implementation plan
  - `FEASIBILITY_ANALYSIS.md` - Architecture analysis and decisions
  - `PARALLEL_POC_TESTING_METHODOLOGY.md` - Testing approach

- **Coordination Files:** Files used during POC validation tests
  - `INTERFACES.md` - TypeScript interface contracts
  - `FILE_OWNERSHIP.md` - File boundaries for parallel work
  - `PROGRESS.md` - POC progress tracking
  - `TODO_WS*.md` - Workstream task lists

- **Quick Start Guides:** Instructions for running the POC
  - `QUICK_START_PARALLEL_DROIDS.md`, `QUICK_START_PARALLEL_POC.md`

- **Documentation Guidelines:**
  - `DOCUMENTATION_ORDER.md` - PRD vs Tech Spec guidelines

### `/session-notes/` - Development Session Notes (Oct 2024)

Notes from specific development sessions, preserved for historical context:

- `THIS_SESSION.md` - Session summary and context
- `RESUME_HERE.md` - Quick resume guide for continuing work
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` - Options for POC execution

## Status of POC Implementation

The parallel orchestration POC was **successfully validated** in October 2024:

- ✅ Validation tests passed (single and two-droid tests)
- ✅ Core implementations completed (Phases 1, 5, 6, 7)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite created
- ✅ Files created: `synchronization.ts`, `staging.ts`, `merger.ts`, `eventBus.ts`, `resourceMatcher.ts`

The implementation files are now part of the main codebase at `src/mcp/execution/`.

## Why These Files Are Archived

These documents served their purpose during the research and POC phases. Now that the features are implemented and tested, the **current documentation** in the main repo provides the authoritative guide to the system.

**For current documentation, see:**
- `/README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- `/QUICKSTART.md` - 5-minute getting started guide
- `/docs/` - Technical documentation and API references
- `/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contributor guidelines
